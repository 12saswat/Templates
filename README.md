# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Technologies Used

### Tailwind CSS
This project uses **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS. It helps to keep the styles modular and consistent across the project.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
